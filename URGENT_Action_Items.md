# PM33 URGENT ACTION ITEMS
## Critical Issues to Fix Before Investor Outreach

---

## STOP - DO NOT SEND TO INVESTORS UNTIL THESE ARE FIXED

### Issue #1: MRR Projections Contradict Each Other

**Problem:**
- Pitch Deck: $50K MRR by March 2025
- Investor Deck: $100K MRR by March 2026
- Investor Deck: $109K MRR by Month 6

**Fix Required:**
Choose ONE scenario and stick to it across all materials.

**Recommended:**
```
Conservative: $50K MRR by Q2 2025 (June 2025)
Base Case: $75K MRR by Q2 2025
Aggressive: $100K MRR by Q2 2025
```

---

### Issue #2: Missing Current Traction Data

**Problem:**
- Claims "paying customers" but no current MRR stated
- "Beta live" but unclear if monetized
- No current metrics shown

**Fix Required:**
State clearly in EVERY document:

```
Current Status (October 2024):
- Platform: [Beta / Live]
- Users: [X] active users
- Revenue: $[X]K MRR OR "Monetization begins [Date]"
- Customers: [X] paying customers OR "[X] in pilot"
```

---

### Issue #3: Value Proposition Math Errors

**Problem:**
- States: 500 tokens = $37,500 value
- But: 500 × $125 = $62,500 (not $37,500)

**Fix Required:**
Remove all specific ROI multiplier claims. Replace with:

```
"Each operation replaces 30 minutes of strategic analysis"
"Starter tier: 500 operations/month"
"Typical consultant cost: $125/hour = $62.5K/month value"
```

---

### Issue #4: Market Size Inconsistency

**Problem:**
- Pitch Deck: $2.1B market
- Investor Deck: $30B TAM, $3.5B SAM

**Fix Required:**
Use consistent TAM/SAM/SOM across all materials:

```
TAM: $30B (Global PM software market)
SAM: $3.5B (AI-enhanced PM tools, 13% CAGR)
SOM: $120M (5,000 teams, our 3-year target)
```

Add citations from Gartner/Forrester/IDC.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do Today)

1. **Create Master Metrics Sheet**
   - ONE source of truth for all numbers
   - Update both presentations from this sheet
   - Lock down version control

2. **Fix Both HTML Files**
   - Reconcile MRR projections to single scenario
   - Add current traction metrics
   - Remove or fix value proposition math
   - Align market sizing

3. **Document Assumptions**
   - How did you calculate $50K/$75K/$100K MRR?
   - What's the customer count and ARPU behind each?
   - What's the conversion rate assumption?
   - What's the CAC by channel?

## RECOMMENDED INVESTOR-READY METRICS

### What to Show on Website/Deck

**Traction Metrics:**
```

✓ "[X] companies in active pilots"
✓ "First revenue: [Month/Year]" OR "$[X]K MRR"
✓ "[X] qualified opportunities in pipeline"
```

**Growth Projections:**
```
✓ "Target: $50-75K MRR by Q2 2025"
✓ "Path to $500K MRR by Month 18"

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

**What Investors Will Question:**

1. Inconsistent numbers across materials
2. Missing current state metrics
3. Inflated value claims (1,000x ROI)
4. Unrealistic growth (0 to $100K in 6 months with no traction)
5. Market sizing without citations
6. Math errors in core value props

**How to Address:**

1. Use ONE set of numbers everywhere
2. Be transparent about current stage
3. Remove ROI multipliers, use comparative value
4. Show 3 scenarios (conservative/base/aggressive)
5. Cite Gartner/Forrester for all market claims
6. Triple-check all math

**Remember:** Better to be conservative and credible than aggressive and questioned.
